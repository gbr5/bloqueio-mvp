### 3. Database Verification

After creating a room:

  ```

- [ ] Verify "Start Game" button is **disabled** (need 2+ players)
- [ ] Verify "Leave Room" button works → Returns to home

### 7. Error Handling

- [ ] Test with database disconnected (if possible)
- [ ] Verify error messages display correctly
- [ ] Verify loading states clear on error
- [ ] Verify user can retry after error

## Expected Server Logs

```
🎮 [Server Action] createGameRoom called
📊 Initial state: {
  "players": [],
  "blockedEdges": [],
  "barriers": [],
  "currentPlayerId": 0,
  "winner": null
}
🔑 Generated room code: ABC123
✅ Room created successfully: [{ room_code: 'ABC123' }]
```

## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Database Schema Mismatch ✅ FIXED
- **Found:** 1:22 PM
- **Fixed:** 1:22 PM (5 minutes)
- **Problem:** Server Actions used `room_code` column, but schema has `id` column
- **Root Cause:** Schema in `init-db.sql` uses different column naming:
  - `id` (TEXT) instead of `room_code`
  - `host_player_id` and `current_player_id` required fields
- **Solution:** Updated all Server Actions to match actual schema
  - `createGameRoom`: INSERT with id, host_player_id, current_player_id
  - `loadGameRoom`: SELECT WHERE id = ...
  - `updateGameRoom`: UPDATE current_player_id
- **Commit:** `6811367`
- **Status:** ✅ Ready to retest
